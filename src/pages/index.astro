        <h3>As a person,</h3>
        <p>
          I always thinking about what should I do, I find myself a philosopher.
          When deeply thinking about something, especially abstract or complex I
          try to define that with few words. For describing something with few
          words, someone might say that it is making details ambiguous. However,
          in cases, some words that have definite meaning makes the essence of
          whole problem explicit. What usually I thinking is something like <em
            >"So, what is really important?"</em
          > or <em>"What is really going on now?"</em>
           or <em>"How to resolve this problem in nice way?"</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd love to deliver rich and helpful words to audience, listen to
          various stories, speeches.
        </p>

        <h3>Looking for a good partner?</h3>
        <p>
          Here I am. As a teammate, friend, collegue, coworker, I can serve as a
          supporter, backup. I experienced various situations in teams on
          projects, studies and communities.

        <h3>Not afraid of being a leader.</h3>
        <p>
          When there is a place to be taken under high responsibility, duty for
          showing a way to go, with embracing the rest, I can serve them.
